# Deep Learning Based RF Signal Classification

This project presents a deep learning approach to classify wireless RF signals by their modulation types. Using the **RadioML 2018.01A** dataset, we train a hybrid **CNN + LSTM** model to distinguish between 8 different modulation schemes from raw I/Q data.

> âœ… Final test accuracy: **90.66%**

## ðŸ“¡ Selected Modulation Classes

- BPSK
- QPSK
- 16PSK
- 4ASK
- 32APSK
- 16QAM
- FM
- AM-DSB-WC

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Separate CNN branches for I and Q inputs
- Feature merging followed by LSTM layer
- Fully connected layers with LeakyReLU + Dropout
- Softmax output for classification
